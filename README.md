# GRBL
Discover workings of T8 Engraver (Arduino based)
Purchased the engraver with no paperwork. Arduino accepts memory flash and GRBL Controller is able to communicate with it. Send command line instructions or Soft Jog, Arduino Uno echos them back to GRBL Controller, but the commands don't make it through the CNC shield and Stepper Drivers to operate the Stepper Motors.
